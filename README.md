# Chicago-Crime-Regression-Analysis
My contribution to a group project where I built regression models using R to predict the daily number of batteries and robberies in Chicago using four different datasets.
This is my first R project and could use improvement on organization and comments. 
The data final table uploaded is a combination of the data from the four sources below along with user coded holday data. 

The Crime data came from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-crime/metadata
The Chicago Park District Event Permit data came from the Chicago Data Portal at https://data.cityofchicago.org/Events/Chicago-Park-District-Event-Permits/pk66-w54g
The weather data was from the Midwestern Regional Climate Center found athttps://mrcc.illinois.edu/
The unemployment data is from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics at https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm
